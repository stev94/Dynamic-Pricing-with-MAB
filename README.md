# Dynamic pricing with MAB

Several implementation of MAB algorithms for solving the dynamic pricing problem applied to the scenario of selling parking lots in a private parking around Milano. The work can be extended to include more parkings also in different areas.
The algorithm implemented are of three types: stationary, non-stationary, contextual. In the three case two policies have been implemented: the UCB1 that uses a frequentist approach and the Thompson Sampling policy, that instead uses a bayesian approach to learn the optimal price per hour.
